summary: 'With the Opportunity Card (“Chancenkarte”), candidates from non-EU countries can enter Germany to look for a suitable job. They do not have to show proof of a permanent employment contract. The Opportunity Card is issued to candidates recognised as skilled workers or those who score at least six points using the points system. In addition, their means of support must be guaranteed for the duration of their stay.'
